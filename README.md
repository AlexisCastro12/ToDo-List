## :dart: Description

To-Do List is an application... <!--To-Do List is an application that allows you to add as many pending tasks as you have, just type and press enter.-->

## :sparkles: Roadmap

The characteristics that this project currently has are:

:heavy_check_mark: You can add pending tasks just by typing them and pressing enter in the only input (last box) of the application.

:heavy_check_mark: You can remove completed tasks by clicking the red button with the symbol :heavy_minus_sign:.

The main objective of this project is... <!-- to learn how to manipulate the DOM of a web application. Also, its purpose is to handle events such as the movement of the pointer on the browser window. In the first instance, the application has fulfilled its objective, however, it is still possible to make improvements to complement it, such as:-->

:pushpin: Make a connection to a small database so that different users can access their own to-do list.

:pushpin: Differentiate between completed tasks and deleted tasks.

:pushpin: Add a small trash can where recent deleted tasks are located.

:pushpin: Allow a user to have more than one to-do list
