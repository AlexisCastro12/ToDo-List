## :dart: Description

To-Do List is an application that allows you to add as many pending tasks as you have, simply by typing and pressing enter thanks to the user interface built with responsive concepts such as functional components and hooks.

## :sparkles: Roadmap

The characteristics that this project currently has are:

:heavy_check_mark: You can add pending tasks just by typing them and pressing enter in the only input (last box) of the application.

:heavy_check_mark: You can remove completed tasks by clicking the red button with the symbol :heavy_minus_sign:.

The main objective of this project is to begin to handle the combined syntax of JS and HTML to create jsx files to build applications with React. It also seeks to work with the state and the nesting of functional components of a React application. Until this update the initial purpose has been fulfilled, however, it is possible to make improvements to complement the project within which the following are proposed:-->

:pushpin: Make a connection to a small database so that different users can access their own to-do list.

:pushpin: Differentiate between completed tasks and deleted tasks.

:pushpin: Add a small trash can where recent deleted tasks are located.

:pushpin: Allow a user to have more than one to-do list

## :white_check_mark: Requirements

Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

## :checkered_flag: Starting

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/AlexisCastro12/ToDo-List.git
